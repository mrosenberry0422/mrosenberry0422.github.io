            I completed this project in Fall 2025 for Computer Architecture Concepts(CGS3269), which consisted of creating a program in MARIE computer assembly language that computes the expression, (a*b)*(c*d)*e, with all the variables reading user input. Every time a input value was read, it was also validated to see if it was a postive number, and if it was,the number was displayed to the screen, otherwise it would display zero and end the program.
